# testTypeScript
just testing for typescript

## compile on MacOS

* 1st, you need to install typescript onto your mac os

I assume that you already installed Homebrew onto your computer. 

* install typescript

brew install typescript

* Compile typescript 

tsc  --target es5 sampletest.ts

* MacOSX already have javascript interprinter named osascript. So, you do not need to install any other javascript engine onto your computer (if you do not want to install addtionaly.)

osascript sampletest.js
